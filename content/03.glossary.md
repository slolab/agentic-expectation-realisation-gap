## Glossary of experimental terms {.page_break_before}

This review draws on evidence from controlled experiments across multiple domains.
The following terms, standard in medicine, economics, and the social sciences, are used throughout.

### Randomised controlled trial (RCT) {#glossary-rct}

An experimental design in which participants are randomly assigned to either a *treatment* group or a *control* group.
Random assignment ensures that observed differences in outcomes can be attributed to the intervention rather than to pre-existing differences between groups.
In this review, RCTs include trials of AI coding assistants, ambient clinical scribes, and clinical decision-support models.

### Treatment and intervention {#glossary-treatment}

The *treatment* (or *intervention*) is the condition being evaluated in an experiment---for example, giving developers access to an AI coding assistant or equipping physicians with an ambient scribe.
Participants who receive the treatment are referred to as *treated participants* or the *treatment group*.

### Control {#glossary-control}

The *control* condition is the comparison group that does not receive the intervention.
Control participants continue with their usual workflow, providing a baseline against which the treatment's effect is measured.

### Treatment effect {#glossary-treatment-effect}

The *treatment effect* is the measured difference in outcomes between the treatment group and the control group.
For example, if treated developers complete tasks 20% faster than control developers, the treatment effect is a 20% reduction in completion time.
A treatment effect can be positive (the intervention helps), negative (it hurts), or null (no detectable difference).

### Intention-to-treat analysis {#glossary-itt}

*Intention-to-treat* (ITT) analysis includes all participants as originally assigned---whether or not they actually used the tool.
This preserves the validity of randomisation and reflects real-world conditions, where not everyone who is offered a tool adopts it.
ITT estimates are typically smaller than per-use estimates because non-adopters dilute the measured effect.

### Heterogeneous treatment effects {#glossary-hte}

*Heterogeneous treatment effects* means that the size (or direction) of the treatment effect varies across subgroups.
For instance, less experienced developers may benefit substantially from AI assistance while expert developers see no gain or a net slowdown.
Recognising heterogeneity is critical for deployment planning: an average treatment effect can mask the fact that some users benefit greatly while others are harmed.
